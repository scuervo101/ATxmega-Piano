# ATxmega-Piano
Synthesizer Piano Player made using the ATxMega128A1u

*Lab8_5 has the piano, all other lab folders were a part of an assignment*

XMega communicates through UART to a serial console on your PC. The console then takes keys (w e r t y u i and 3 4 6 7 8) to emulate a 
piano.

# PuTTY settings:
